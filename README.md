# Replixel

Replixel is a fun playground of mine to play around and learn more about [CRDTs](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/)

The idea is to create a small and simple collaborative peer-to-peer drawing application and simulate
losing connectivity between peers.

The goal of the project is then to implement a data structure based on CRDT to reconcile
the state between peers and resolve conflicts automatically
